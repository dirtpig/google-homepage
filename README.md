## scope- 

* I will be recreating the google homepage with html/css 

## closing thoughts -

* I spent a lot longer on this than I thought I would have. I learned a lot more about pseudo classes; specifically .:hover and shaping my containers to look more fluid. I did do a lot of research throughout the project and I did watch a youtube video to help work out some things I was stuck on but overall I am very happy with the outcome.
